Hyperspace FX 2
===============

This asset features one warp tunnel shader and a bundle of particle system effects for a hyperspace travel effect. Combine them to get your wanted look.

Bloom is recommended to be enabled for these effects.

WarpTunnel Shader
===============

The warptunnel shader features a variety of options to customize the effect further.

You can smoothly animate the tunnel to fade in or out using the Transparency slider, set the Power of the Warp Texture to make it brighter in Bloom, or you can adjust the Scroll Speed. The Warp Texture is also easy to change out.

Shader was made with Amplify Shader Editor.
